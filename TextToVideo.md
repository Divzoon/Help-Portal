# Limitations
The model does not achieve perfect photorealism
The model cannot render legible text
The model struggles with more difficult tasks which involve compositionality, such as rendering an image corresponding to “A red cube on top of a blue sphere”
Faces and people in general may not be generated properly.
# Bias
While the capabilities of video generation models are impressive, they can also reinforce or exacerbate social biases.
