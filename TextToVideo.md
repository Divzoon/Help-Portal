## Plan

Since there is no API for Hotshot-XL, we will:

1. Host it on free servers.
2. Automate and scrape the Hotshot-XL demo website to generate GIFs.

## Limitations

* The model does not achieve perfect photorealism.
* The model cannot render legible text.
* The model struggles with more difficult tasks that involve compositionality, such as rendering an image corresponding to "A red cube on top of a blue sphere."
* Faces and people in general may not be generated properly.

## Bias

Video generation models can reinforce or exacerbate social biases.
