# PhaseOne Plan 

## Goals
- Generate the titles according to the company information and needs.
- Generate a full detailed documentation with a complete structure.
- Save the docs as a markdown (`.md`) file.

## Guidelines
- The code is written in JavaScript (Node.js).
- We use ES6 syntax in our JavaScript code.
- The functions in JavaScript are decoupled, allowing us to perform operations between different phases.

## Main File
The `index.js` file is the main entry point of our application. It contains the reference to `gpt-3.5-turbo` and coordinates the execution of the different phases.

```javascript
gpt-3.5-turbo
