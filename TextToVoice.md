# Bark AI Model Can convert text to voice with no APIs ?

- So it's a Model that We can Do a ReSearch on How it works internally and just use it with our Project
- i saw the code and the implementation of it and it's so simple 
- it needs a 12gb memory so it works perfectly but it can be custolmizable to be used for ~ 2gb.

# Bark AI Model:

- Voice Cloning
- Text-Prompted Generative Audio
- Multilingual Voices
- Customizable Voices
- including music, background noise and simple sound effects.
- laughing, sighing and crying.
-  You can now use Bark with GPUs that have low VRAM (<4GB).


# Challenges:
- By default, generate_audio works well with around 13 seconds of spoken text. For an example of how to do long-form generation, see ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/suno-ai/bark/blob/main/notebooks/long_form_generation.ipynb  ðŸ‘ˆ
   - Solution: in short a for loop to map every sentence.
