## We Have 3 Options

### Option 1: Generate the voice of each word separately and attach it to a .wav file.

This option is the simplest to implement, but it will result in a voice that sounds unnatural and robotic. This is because humans do not speak each word in isolation, but rather in a fluid and continuous stream.

### Option 2: Use an AI model to detect the voice again and match it with words.

This option would result in a more natural-sounding voice, but it would be more complex to implement and would require a large and powerful AI model.

### Option 3: Generate the voice of one sentence at a time and attach it to the text of the voice.

This option is a good compromise between the first two options. It is relatively easy to implement and will result in a more natural-sounding voice than Option 1, but not as natural as Option 2.

**I recommend Option 3, as it is the best balance of simplicity and performance.**
