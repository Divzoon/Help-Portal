# Build an Information rettrieval enteractive chatbot

## Introduction

This project is a chatbot that can answer questions about the content of a given dataset and Data that provided by customer representative. The Data is in the form of a text file that contains the questions and answers, and Documentation.

## Types of chatbots

There are two types of chatbots:

1. **Rule-Based approach**: This approach is based on if-else conditions. It is a simple approach but it is not scalable. It is not able to handle complex queries.

2. **Self learning approach**: This approach is based on machine learning algorithms. It is a complex approach but it is scalable. It is able to handle complex queries.

   - **Generative chatbots**: These chatbots are based on sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) neural networks.
     - They are able to generate new responses from scratch.
     - They are not able to remember the context of the conversation.

   - **Retrieval-based chatbots**: These chatbots are based on retrieving the best response from a list of responses.
     - They are able to remember the context of the conversation.
     - They are not able to generate new responses from scratch.

## Key Features of the retrieval-based chatbot

- **Knowledge Base**: These chatbots use various matching algorithms to find the best response from the knowledge base. Common matching algorithms are TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), Cosine Similarity, Word2Vec, etc.

- **Accuracy**: Retrieval-based chatbots are known for their accuracy in providing responses, especially in scenarios where the responses are well-defined and specific, such as customer support or information retrieval.

- **Limited Creativity**: Unlike generative chatbots, retrieval-based chatbots do not generate novel responses. They rely on pre-existing answers, making them suitable for tasks where accuracy is more critical than creativity.

- **Scalability**: Retrieval-based chatbots are more scalable than generative chatbots. They can be trained on large datasets and can be deployed on a large scale.

## How does a retrieval-based chatbot work?

Before we dive into understanding how a retrieval-based chatbot works, let’s first understand the components of a **user query**.

- **Intent**: The goal or the purpose behind the user query. For example, the intent of the query “How to learn Python?” is to learn Python.

- **Entity**: The object or the context of the user query. For example, the entity of the query “How to learn Python?” is Python.

- **Context**: The context of the user query. For example, the context of the query “How to learn Python?” is learning.

- **Response**: The response to the user query. For example, the response to the query “How to learn Python?” is “You can learn Python by taking a course on Coursera.” or Suggestions of the most cources that related to the query.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how a retrieval-based chatbot works:

1. **Accepting the user query**: The chatbot accepts the user query in the form of text.

2. **Preprocessing the user query**: The chatbot preprocesses the user query by removing the stop words, stemming, lemmatization, And Extracting the intent, entity, and context of the user query.

3. **Searching for the most appropriate response**: The chatbot searches for the most appropriate response from the knowledge base using various matching algorithms.

4. **Generating the response**: The chatbot generates the response based on the selected response template.

5. **Displaying the response**: The chatbot displays the response to the user.

## Examples of retrieval-based chatbots

- **Flight Booking Chatbot**: This chatbot helps users book flights, check flight status, and get information about flights.

- **Customer Support Chatbot**: This chatbot helps users get answers to their queries related to a product or service.

## How to build a retrieval-based chatbot?

1. **Data Collection**: Collect the data for the knowledge base. The data can be collected from various sources such as FAQs, product manuals, customer support tickets, etc.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing the data by removing the stop words, stemming, lemmatization, and extracting the intent, entity, and context of the user query.

3. **Training the model**: Train the model on the preprocessed data.
The model is trained using various matching algorithms such as:
    - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
    - Cosine Similarity
    - Word2Vec
    - BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

4. **Testing the model**: Test the model on the test dataset. The test dataset is a set of questions and answers that are not present in the training dataset.

5. **Deploying the model**: Deploy the model on a server. The model can be deployed on a server using various frameworks such as Flask, Django, etc.
